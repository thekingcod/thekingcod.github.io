All games, if properly designed, should follow a set of rules, which define how the game should be played. Get in the mind of the game and the developers who designed it. These rules are often unwritten, but invaluable to the way you play. For example, a tactical FPS (first person shooter) will often require that you do not stand in the open if you want to succeed. And in an FPS, learn where to aim in the body with each weapon. Often, youll find that you must aim for the head. But shotguns are more effective in the chest, in most games. Rocket launchers should be aimed at the feet",

A good way to learn skills like not panicking and about the rules of a game, is to play the old classic, Tetris. If you panic in Tetris, you fail. If you learn rules such as do not create gaps, do not create channels and early on in the game, go for four lines at a time.",

They look temptingly simple, but the best keys to use are WASD (W forwards, A left, S backpedal, D right).,Occasionally ESDF or ESCF are used instead for more room. This is because with the arrow keys, there are no other buttons nearby to use. Imagine the scene. Youre playing an FPS, and you need to jump. There is no nearby suitable jump button. Or if you need to reload, where is the reload button? You would have to take your hand off the movement keys, which is bad in a firefight.",

But when you are playing with your team or with your friends, you really should learn how to communicate efficiently. Using TeamSpeak, Xfire voice or Skype is necessary. You will notice that in most games, the player without the voice chat is the one who dies first. The different voice clients all have advantages and disadvantages. Xfire of course lets you type into the conversation in-game as well, so posting a strategy that people can check at any time is easy with xfire. TS creates the least lag for the players.",

What if you found a ridiculous piece of cover which no one would think of checking? Youve tried the big guns? What about taking down an entire army with a knife? For example, me and my friends like to, when we run into enemies in a corridor, throw ourselves to the ground and shoot the ankles. unorthodox, but it catches them off-guard.
